# KuKu's Blog API

## Overview
KuKu's Blog API is a RESTful API that allows users to create, view, edit, and delete blog posts. It supports authentication using JWT, user role-based restrictions, and media storage via Cloudinary. The API is built using **Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB (via Mongoose), and Cloudinary**.

## Features
- User authentication (Signup & Signin) with JWT
- Role-based access control
- CRUD operations for blog posts
- Cloudinary integration for image uploads
- Search functionality for posts
- User management with protected routes

- **verify**: Protects routes and ensures only authenticated users can access certain features.
- **restrict**: Ensures only admin users can access certain endpoints.

## Cloudinary Image Upload Process
### Steps to Upload an Image
1. Install Cloudinary SDK:
   ```sh
   npm install cloudinary
   ```
2. Configure Cloudinary in `config/cloudinary.js`:
   ```js
   import { v2 as cloudinary } from 'cloudinary';

   cloudinary.config({
     cloud_name: process.env.CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME,
     api_key: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_KEY,
     api_secret: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET,
   });

   export default cloudinary;
   ```
3. Modify the `createPost` function to handle image uploads:
   ```js
   import cloudinary from '../config/cloudinary.js';
   import Post from '../models/post.model.js';

   export const createPost = async (req, res, next) => {
     try {
       const { title, content } = req.body;
       let imageUrl = '';

       if (req.file) {
         const uploadResponse = await cloudinary.uploader.upload(req.file.path);
         imageUrl = uploadResponse.secure_url;
       }

       const newPost = new Post({
         title,
         content,
         image: imageUrl,
         user: req.user._id,
       });

       await newPost.save();

       res.status(201).json({ success: true, data: newPost });
     } catch (error) {
       next(error);
     }
   };
   ```
